## Description
This is a triangle-tracker program
## BDD
How this program works is that you enter all the three sides of triangle,if you enter the same three sides it gives u an alert saying it is an Equilateral triangle,then if you click ok it shows you a graph of that equilateral triangle occodingly to the mesures you entered.
When you enter two equal sides and the third is not equal to those twoo,it gives an alert saying it's an Isosceles triangle,then if you click ok it shows also the graph of isosceles triangle.
When you enter three unequal sides it gives an alert saying it's a Scalene triangle and also shows the graph.Else if the sum of any two sides is less or equal to the third side, it gives alert saying it's not a definite triangle.
